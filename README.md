PaintsUndo: A Base Model of Drawing Behaviors in Digital Paintings

Paints-Undo is a project aimed at providing base models of human drawing behaviors with a hope that future AI models can better align with the real needs of human artists.

The name "Paints-Undo" is inspired by the similarity that, the model's outputs look like pressing the "undo" button (usually Ctrl+Z) many times in digital painting software.

Paints-Undo presents a family of models that take an image as input and then output the drawing sequence of that image. The model displays all kinds of human behaviors, including but not limited to sketching, inking, coloring, shading, transforming, left-right flipping, color curve tuning, changing the visibility of layers, and even changing the overall idea during the drawing process.
